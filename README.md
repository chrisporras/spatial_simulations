# Spatial simulations with selection

The goal of this project is to simulate mutation-selection balance in spatially structured populations. We'd like to be able to test our theory of how the site frequency spectrum depends on (1) the spatial sampling scheme, and (2) the strength of selection. The code will consist of a set of wrapper scripts that take population and sample parameters, call existing software tools to run simulations, and parse output to give informative summaries and plot figures.

The work is a collaboration in the Novembre Lab at the University of Chicago between Daniel Rice and Christian Porras.

Details to come.
